# genetic-algorithm-java-brainfuck

This project is part of Middlebury's CS701 Senior Seminar.

The goals of this project are to utilise genetic algorithm as a technique to 'teach' programs to generate other programs. As it is Turing-Complete despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is our choice for doing so.

Steps:
1. Create a basic Java brainfuck interpreter. (Done)
2. Implement infrastructure for quick testing. (Done)
3. Attempt to our first generated "Hello World" program. (Done)
4. Testing on different types of parameters. (In Progress)
    - Varying mutation rate.
    - Varying crossover rate.
    - Varying both rates.

Our eventual goal is a program that will be able to output simple string, and mathematical functions and is able to 'learn' between successive generations. A complex program, such as a music generator, or self-written modules, is our final stretch goal.
